def detect_noises(image: Image.Image):
    """
        Detects noises in an image by analyzing its sharpness, gradient distribution,
        and the count of extreme pixel values. This function computes several metrics
        to determine noise characteristics based on image properties and statistics.

        Arguments:
            image (PIL.Image.Image): The input image to process. It should be readable
            and convertible to grayscale for analysis.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary containing the calculated noise metrics:
                - laplacian_variance (float): Variance of the Laplacian, a measure of
                  sharpness.
                - gradient_mean (float): Mean value of the gradient magnitude
                  computed from the Sobel filter.
                - gradient_std (float): Standard deviation of the gradient magnitude
                  computed from the Sobel filter.
                - gdf_entropy (float): Entropy of the Gradient Distribution Function
                  (GDF), representing the smoothness and variability of gradients in
                  the image.
                - extreme_pixel (float): Percentage of pixels with intensity values
                  near 0 or 255, indicating extreme dark or bright areas.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the input image is None or invalid.

    number of pixels in the image.
